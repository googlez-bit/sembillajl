            Since I was a kid I'm really into technology I vaguely remember that time that I
            got into trouble because I cannot help but to tinkle the computer just to get the
            password for their network. Since then my passion for tech widens. Throughout college,I consistently 
            led group projects, honing my skills. I am eager to learn new technologies 
            required for the job and have proven to be a team player. From 2022 I worked
            as a freelancer and as part-timer for a senior developer in Upwork.

            In 2024, I was fortunate to land my first big project. A medium-sized business in Laguna 
            hired me to create their <b>Inventory and Point of Sale</b> system. I built it using Laravel, SQL, 
            JavaScript, AJAX, Tailwind CSS, and a bit of luck. Since I didn't have a partner for the 
            job, I handled everything myself and full stack the project, from system investigation to deployment.

            Outside my career you will usually find me watching anime and movies. Sometimes I
            go outside as well to jog and go to malls to unwind and to relax. I love eating
            various dishes and I myself also do cooking.
