            In 2019, I served as the lead programmer in a research project
            developing a library system for Bulacan College of Commerce and
            Trade. Using Visual Basic Studio as the IDE, VB.NET for both 
            backend and frontend, and SQL for the database, we aimed to 
            streamline library transactions. This experience motivated me to 
            pursue a related course in college. Throughout college, I consistently 
            led group projects, honing my skills. I am eager to learn new technologies 
            required for the job and have proven to be a team player. Please see the
            project section to view more of my projects!

            Outside my career you will usually find me watching anime and movies. Sometimes I
            go outside as well to jog and go to malls to unwind and to relax. I love eating
            various dishes and I myself also do cooking.
